## Asynchronous Learning

**Asynchronous learning** is a general term used to describe forms of education, instruction, and learning that do not occur in the same place or at the same time. The term is most commonly applied to various forms of digital and online learning in which students learn from instruction—such as prerecorded video lessons or game-based learning tasks that students complete on their own—that is not being delivered in person or in real time. Yet asynchronous learning may also encompass a wide variety of instructional interactions, including email exchanges between teachers, online discussion boards, and course-management systems that organize instructional materials and correspondence, among many other possible variations.

# Positive Environmental Changes

## The Ocean Cleanup Project

About 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans every year which is a travesty - but there are good people working hard at leveraging scalable, energy nuetral, autonamous technologies to remove about half the Great Pacific Garbage Patch in 10 years.

You can find out all about the project and how to help support them here: http://www.theoceancleanup.com/

**NOTES**

The intent is to turn this into a slide-show-web-presentation. I added some basic markup and a very simple server to start the base of this project. The server isn't currently needed but if you want to run it for some odd reason...

1. clone/fork the repo
2. cd to the repo 
3. `npm install express`
4. `nodemon server.js`
